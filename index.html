<h1> Nidhish Gupta's Portfolio</h1>
<p> My name is Nidhish Gupta, and I’ve decided to attend Worcester Technical High School to pursue my career in computer science. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and coding, and I’m excited to dive deeper into this field. My goal is to become a software engineer or developer, creating innovative solutions that can impact the world in meaningful ways. At Worcester Tech, I plan to gain as much knowledge and experience as possible, building a strong foundation for my future. I’m determined to turn my passion for technology into a successful career that I’ll love as I grow older.</p>
